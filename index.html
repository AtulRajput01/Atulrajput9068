			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>My name is Atul Rajput and I am currently a 3rd year computer science and engineering (CSE) student at ABESIT pursuing a Bachelor of Technology (BTech) degree.

I have always been fascinated by the power of technology and the endless possibilities it holds for solving real-world problems. That's what drew me to the field of computer science and engineering.

Throughout my studies, I have had the opportunity to learn about a wide range of topics, including programming languages, computer architecture, operating systems, computer networks, and Devops. I have also had the chance to specialize in a particular area of interest, such as artificial intelligence .

In addition to my coursework, I have also participated in internships and Contribute in Open-Source, which have allowed me to gain practical experience and apply my skills in a real-world setting. These experiences have been invaluable for developing my professional skills and building my network in the field..</p>
